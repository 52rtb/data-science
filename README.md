# data-science
This is my collection of data science related data, it's different from other personal collections, for each package, book, post, slides, examples and websites is not just an element of this collection, I go through every thing listed bellow, and for most of them, I'll write down my personal comment.

My philosophy is that, if one can get what he need in one slide, then it's much wiser to get deep into that slide than download dozens of slides and put them in a well-organized directory.

there is a nice saying: 

***The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.***

and I wanna say: 

***The deeper you go, the better you will become, inside out***

1. packages
---

- [pandas](pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scipy](www.scipy.org)
- [scikit-learn](scikit-learn.org)
- [matplotlib](matplotlib.org)

Do not tell others that your are a Python data scientist if you never touch these packages above.

- [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn)
- [mpld3](http://mpld3.github.io/quickstart.html)

mpld3 is kind of an extention of matplotlib, I like it so much and it's easy enough to use. The kernel of this package is to converting the matplotlit graph object to a dict which can be used to build and html d3 graph.


2. books & courses
---

- [Data Science / Harvard](http://cs109.github.io/2014/pages/schedule.html)

```
Topics: Data wrangling, data management, exploratory data analysis to generate 
hypotheses and intuition, prediction based on statistical methods such as regression 
and classification, communication of results through visualization, stories, and summaries.
```

- [Python for Data Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793)

[github repo for this book](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-book)

```
I'm reading this book currently, not for it can provide some deep knowledge of data science, but I
think it can help data science fresh man to accumulate more fundamental, basic conception of data science.
And, it can be very helpful for people who don't know ipython, pandas and numpy and some useful packages
and method for data science.
```



3. posts & slides
---

- [McKinsey Report Highlights the Impending Data Scientist Shortage](http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/news-2/mckinsey-report-highlights-the-impending-data-scientist-shortage)

```
A report that inllustrates the shortage of data scientist in America, and 
different industries' need for data scientists.
```

- [airbnb-tech-talk-josh-wills-on-the-life-of-a-data-scientist](http://www.slideshare.net/naseemh/airbnb-tech-talk-josh-wills-on-the-life-of-a-data-scientist)

```
Actually, I didn't find too much about a data scientist's daily work. 
But I like the material in this slide.
```

And, I fully recommend this video, it's much more value if you wanna know the daily routine as a Data Scientist. [Gigs: A day in the life of a data scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaptTxhh6sM)

- [choosing_a_good_chart](http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/files/choosing_a_good_chart.pdf)

```
A very useful graph on how to choose an appropriate visulization type, I like it.
```

- [Questions From Data Science Interviews](http://blog.udacity.com/2015/04/data-science-interview-questions.html)

```
A high quality article on talking about how to find a data scientist candidate from an interviewer's eye.
```

- [Doing Data Science at Twitter](https://medium.com/@rchang/my-two-year-journey-as-a-data-scientist-at-twitter-f0c13298aee6)



4. examples
---

- [Happy Healthy Hungry -- San Francisco](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Jay-Oh-eN/happy-healthy-hungry/blob/master/h3.ipynb)

```
An very awesome notebook build by <Zipfian Academy>, a data science training company, 
it doesn't provide too much statistic and analytic work, but I really like it, 
it will share you the method and step of figuring out a data science related problem, 
and using matplotlib and pandas to build awesome graph, that's really fantastic. 
Anyway, I like this example so much. 
```


5. websites & repos
---

- [datascienceweekly](http://www.datascienceweekly.org/)

```
This is really an awesome blog, containing lots of high-quality resources for learning
data science. It has three type of resource: blog, interview question and resources. Each
of these three are good enough, and you can subscribe this website, it will send you an 
email every week, that's very nice. Anyway, I fully recommend this site.
```


- [Learn Data Science](http://nborwankar.github.io/LearnDataScience/)

```
There are many useful resource about data science, and what is most excited 
is that there are so many examples in Ipython Notebook, which is really valuable.
I will go through all the notebooks here, and put it one by one on this repo, 
bellow the 'examples' directory.
```
- [A gallery of interesting IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)

```
This is one of the most useful data like above, it not just focus on data science, 
but there are also many data related, high-quality Ipython Notebooks example,
so it has lots of value for me. Also, I'll go through some of the notebooks in 
the repo and put it into this repo if needed.
```

- [scientific-python-lectures](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures)

```
A very simple tutorial on some most useful packages on Python data science.
```

- [data-science-blogs](https://github.com/rushter/data-science-blogs)

```
A github repo collecting some high quality data science related blogs or
websites, really valuable.
```
